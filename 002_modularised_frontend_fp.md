# Modularized Front-End. Part 2: FP way

> All code examples you can find [here](https://github.com/denistakeda/modulas)

We are going to implement a very simple quiz app. Every question in the quiz
should have multiple answers but only one of them is correct.
A user can answer a question, navigate between questions back, forth, and by
index.
And when all the questions are answered one can finish the quiz and see his score.

In the previous article we implemented this logic in the OOP way, and now goes
more clean FP one.

## How to model data FP way

## Use modules instead of classes

TODO

## Everything should be readonly

TODO

## Use algebraic data types

TODO

## Keep data and operations on data close

TODO

## Incapsulation, FP way (Opaque types)

TODO

## Render is just a function
